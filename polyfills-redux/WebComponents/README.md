## About Grunt

You need `grunt-cli` to run the grunt task from the command line.

> `npm install -g grunt-cli`

You need `grunt` itself, and some plugins (as shown,installs locally).

> `WebComponents> npm install grunt`  
> `WebComponents> npm install grunt-contrib-concat`  
> `WebComponents> npm install grunt-contrib-uglify`  

Now the build task should be available:

> `WebComponents> grunt`

TODO: make a `package.json` so this is easier.
