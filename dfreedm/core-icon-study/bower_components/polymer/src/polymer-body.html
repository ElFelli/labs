/**
 * The `polymer-body` element extends the body element. It provides a quick and 
 * easy way to do data binding without the need to setup a custom element 
 * or template. The body itself serves as the model and controller for the 
 * elements it contains. Both data and event handlers can be bound. 
 *
 * The `polymer-body` element does not create any ShadowDOM. Instead, 
 * it creates elements in the main document. This makes it convenient to use 
 * when it's important that elements are not placed inside ShadowDOM.
 *
 * The `polymer-body` element provides a subset of the capability you 
 * get when you define a custom element. When you put data and event listeners
 * on `polymer-body`, you're customizing an instance of the element.
 * Because of this you cannot define lifecycle methods like ready. If you need
 * to do this, make a custom element.
 * 
 * Example:
 *
 *     <body is="polymer-body">
 *       <template>
 *         {{greeting}}
 *         <button on-tap="buttonTap">Tap me!</button>
 *       </template>
 *       <script>
 *         model.greeting = 'Hello!';
 *         model.buttonTap = function() {
 *           console.log('tap!');
 *         };
 *       </script>
 *     </body>
 *
 * @status stable

    /*
      Normally, it would be required to load polymer-body last to ensure 
      its contained elements bind properly. However, for convenience, we load
      `polymer-body` with polymer and register it at `polymer-ready` time.
      This means that `polymer-body` is ready asynchronous to the 
      `polymer-ready` event.

    // upgrade polymer-body last so that 
    // 1. it can contain other imported elements without needing to come last
    // 2. scripts that customize the model are not required to be before
    // polymer-body is loaded (note: native imports block scripts).
